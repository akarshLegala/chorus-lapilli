Project Setup
Create React App

Ran npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe to initialize the project.
Verified the structure: src, public, and other necessary files were generated.
Install Dependencies

    Installed dependencies for the project, though none were specifically needed outside of React for this basic version.
Implementing Components
    Square Component
        Created Square component to render individual cells of the board.
        Passed value and onSquareClick as props.
        Tested component by hardcoding a few values to ensure buttons rendered correctly.
    Board Component
        Created Board component to arrange the 3x3 grid.
        Integrated Square components and connected click handlers.
        Added a handleClick function to prevent clicks on already occupied squares or after a win.
    Game Component
        Built the main Game component to handle the game state and history.
        Used useState hooks to manage history (an array of board states) and currentMove (track move progression).
    Winning Logic
        Defined calculateWinner function to check for winning conditions.
        Updated handleClick to call calculateWinner after each move.
        Tested functionality by playing a few games and verifying win detection.
    History Feature
        Added move history tracking in the Game component.
        Created buttons to allow users to "jump" to previous moves.
        Verified that jumpTo function updates the game state to show the selected move.
    Display Next Player
        Added logic to display which player's turn it is.
        Verified by toggling between "Next player: X" and "Next player: O" as the game progresses.
    Styling
        CSS for Layout
        Created index.css to style the game.
        Added styles to align the board and buttons, ensuring the 3x3 grid layout.
    Summary of Components
        Game
        Manages the game state and renders the main layout.
        Board
        Displays a grid of squares and handles user input.
        Square
        Represents a single cell on the tic-tac-toe board.
    Code Notes
        calculateWinner function iterates through potential win lines, confirming a winner if three squares contain the same symbol.
        useState for history and currentMove effectively enables move tracking and game state management.
Final Thoughts
Successfully implemented tic-tac-toe using React.
The Game component structure and history tracking allow easy extension for future features, such as resetting the game.
